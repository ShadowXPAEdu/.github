# Technologies and Programming of Information Systems (TPSI)

The course was a higher education course, and had 19 subjects spread throughout 4 semesters (2 years). I started the course in 2017, and finished it in 2019.  
Each year corresponds to 60 [ECTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System). Naturally the 2 years corresponded to 120 ECTS.

# Bachelor's in Informatics Engineering (LEI)

The course had 32 subjects spread throughout 6 semesters (3 years). I started the course in 2019 after finishing the [higher education course](#technologies-and-programming-of-information-systems-tpsi), and finished it in 2022.  
In the end the total number of ECTS was 185.  
Since I finished the previous course, some of the subjects were automatically credited (I did not have to redo the subjects). This also means I had more free time, and so, I decided to do some subjects earlier.
