# About

This organization holds most of the projects made during my ([@ShadowXPA](https://github.com/ShadowXPA)) academic career. It also includes projects done with colleagues.  

## Repositories

Each repository holds all the code produced. Some may not work, others may require addicional setup. Either way, since this is exclusively for archiving, I will not be troubleshooting.  
The **README.md** files, inside each repository, contains the assignment, objective, team, and final grade.
